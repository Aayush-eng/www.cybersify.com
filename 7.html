    <p>&#9802 <b>Device files</b></p>
    <p>Device files are also known as <b>device special files</b>. Device files are employed to provide the operating system and users an interface to the devices that they represent. All Linux device files are located in the /dev directory, which is an integral part of the root (/) filesystem because these device files must be available to the operating system during the boot process.</p>
    <p>One of the most important things to remember about these device files is that they are most definitely not device drivers. They are more accurately described as portals to the device drivers. Data is passed from an application or the operating system to the device file which then passes it to the device driver which then sends it to the physical device. The reverse data path is also used, from the physical device through the device driver, the device file, and then to an application or another device.</p>
    <p>Let's look at the data flow of a typical command to visualize this.</p>
    <center><img src="d4.png" style="border: 3px solid black" height="50%" ></center>
    <p>Above, a simplified data flow is shown for a common command. Issuing the cat /etc/resolv.conf command from a GUI terminal emulator such as Konsole or xterm causes the resolv.conf file to be read from the disk with the disk device driver handling the device specific functions such as locating the file on the hard drive and reading it. The data is passed through the device file and then from the command to the device file and device driver for pseudo-terminal 6 where it is displayed in the terminal session.</p>
    <p>Of course, the output of the cat command could have been redirected to a file in the following manner, cat /etc/resolv.conf > /etc/resolv.bak in order to create a backup of the file. In that case, the data flow on the left side of Figure 1 would remain the same while the data flow on the right would be through the /dev/sda2 device file, the hard drive device driver and then onto the hard drive itself.</p>
    <p>These device files make it very easy to use standard streams (STD/IO) and redirection to access any and every device on a Linux or Unix computer. Simply directing a data stream to a device file sends the data to that device.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Device files can be classified in at least two ways. The first and most commonly used classification is that of the data stream commonly associated with the device. For example, tty (teletype) and serial devices are considered to be character based because the data stream is transferred and handled one character or byte at a time. Block type devices such as hard drives transfer data in blocks, typically a multiple of 256 bytes.</p>
    <p>If you have not already, go ahead and as a non-root user in a terminal session, change the present working directory (PWD) to /dev and display a long listing. This shows a list of device files with their file permissions and their major and minor identification numbers. For example, the following device files are just a few of the ones in the /dev/directory on my Fedora 24 workstation. They represent disk and tty type devices. Notice the leftmost character of each line in the output. The ones that have a "b" are block type devices and the ones that begin with "c" are character devices.</p>

    <p>The more detailed and explicit way to identify device files is using the device major and minor numbers. The disk devices have a major number of 8 which designates them as SCSI block devices. Note that all PATA and SATA hard drives have been managed by the SCSI subsystem because the old ATA subsystem was many years ago deemed as not maintainable due to the poor quality of its code. As a result, hard drives that would previously have been designated as "hd[a-z]" are now referred to as "sd[a-z]".</p>
    <p>You can probably infer the pattern of disk drive minor numbers in the small sample shown above. Minor numbers 0, 16, 32 and so on up through 240 are the whole disk numbers. So major/minor 8/16 represents the whole disk /dev/sdb and 8/17 is the device file for the first partition, /dev/sdb1. Numbers 8/34 would be /dev/sdc2.</p>
    <p>The tty device files in the list above are numbered a bit more simply from tty0 through tty63.</p>
    <p>The Linux Allocated Devices file at Kernel.org is the official registry of device types and major and minor number allocations. It can help you understand the major/minor numbers for all currently defined devices.</p>
    <h1 style="background-color:#e699ff";><img src="pen.jpeg" height="60" width="60" align="left">Creating device files</h1>
    <p>In the past, the device files in /dev were all created at installation time, resulting in a directory full of almost every possible device file, even though most would never be used. In the unlikely event that a new device file was needed or one was accidentally deleted and needed to be re-created, the mknod program was available to manually create device files. All you had to know was the device major and minor numbers.</p>
   <p>CentOS and RHEL 6 and 7, as well as all versions of Fedora going back to at least as far Fedora 15, use the newer method of creating the device files. All device files are created at boot time. This functionality is possible because the udev device manager detects addition and removal of devices as they occur. This allows for true dynamic plug-n-play functionality while the host is up and running. It also performs the same task at boot time by detecting all devices installed on the system very early in the boot process. Linux.com has a good description of udev.</p>
   <p>Going back to your listing of the files in /dev, notice the date and time on the files. All of them were created during the last boot. You can verify this using the uptime or last commands. In my device listing above, all of those files were created at 7:06 AM on November 7, which is the last time I booted the system.</p>
   <p>Of course, the mknod command is still available, but the new MAKEDEV (yes, in all uppercase : which in my opinion is contrary to the Linux philosophy of using all lowercase command names) command provides an easier interface for creating device files, should the need arise. The MAKEDEV command is not installed by default in current versions of Fedora or CentOS 7; it is installed in CentOS 6. You can use YUM or DNF to install the MAKEDEV package.</p>
